Predicting Investor-Owned Electric Utility Companies in the U.S.

Dataset Description:

The dataset is from data.gov and was compiled by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) using data from ABB, the Velocity Suite, and the U.S. Energy Information Administrationâ€™s Form 861. It includes information about utility names, ownership type, residential/commercial rates, number of customers, and zip codes.

Prediction Goal:
We aim to build a machine learning model to predict whether an electric utility company is investor-owned or not, using relevant numerical and categorical features from the dataset.
